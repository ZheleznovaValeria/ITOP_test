# ITOP_test

Test for ITOP by Zheleznova Valeria 
So, I've made a stopwatch using react-hooks. I couldn't do it using RxJS because I have no skills in it.

Stopwatch has 3 buttons: 
1. "Start/Stop" 
2. "Wait"
3. "Reset" 

"Start" and "Reset" buttons are active, "Wait" button is inactive until the stopwatch has started.

After starting stopwatch the "Start" button changes to a "Stop" button. 
When the "Wait" button is pressed, time counting stops and can be resumed by pressing the "Start" button. 
"Reset" button resets the time and starts counting again.
